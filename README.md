## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following are installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for Flask backend)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) (for local database)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopease.git
   cd shopease
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

3. **Backend Setup**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start the Flask backend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

4. **MongoDB Compass Setup**
   - MongoDB Compass will be used for local data storage. The database will be automatically created when you run the backend server.
   - Make sure MongoDB Compass is running locally, and the Flask app will handle the creation of the database and collections.

5. **Data Source**
   - The product data is loaded dynamically from a CSV file, which is parsed and inserted into MongoDB Compass.
   - The CSV file is located in the backend directory, and the data is automatically fed into the database when the server starts.
